## Introduction

> Laravel Breeze React is the implementation for react from [breeze-next](https://github.com/laravel/breeze-next). 

Laravel Breeze React is an implementing of the [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits) authentication template for [React App](https://react.dev). All of the authentication boilerplate is already written for you - powered by [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum), allowing you to quickly begin pairing your beautiful React frontend with a powerful Laravel backend.

## Vite

Laravel Breeze React is now turbocharged with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for rapid compilation and efficient production builds. To know more about Vite check out [this article](https://dev.to/nilanth/use-vite-for-react-apps-instead-of-cra-3pkg).

## Quick Start

### Installation

First, create a React App compatible Laravel backend by installing Laravel Breeze into a [fresh Laravel application](https://laravel.com/docs/installation) and installing Breeze's API scaffolding:

```bash
# Create the Laravel application...
laravel new react-backend

cd react-backend

# Install Breeze and dependencies...
composer require laravel/breeze

php artisan breeze:install api
```

Next, ensure that your application's `APP_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` environment variables are set to `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:3000`, respectively.

After defining the appropriate environment variables, you may serve the Laravel application using the `serve` Artisan command:

```bash
# Serve the application...
php artisan serve
```

Next, clone this repository and install its dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`. Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and supply the URL of your backend:

```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Finally, run the application via `yarn start`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`:

```
yarn start --host localhost --port 3000
```
or to be accesible from of any host in the LAN:
```
yarn start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

> Note: Currently, we recommend using `localhost` during local development of your backend and frontend to avoid CORS "Same-Origin" issues.

### Authentication Hook

This Create React application contains a custom `useAuth` React hook, designed to abstract all authentication logic away from your pages. In addition, the hook can be used to access the currently authenticated user:

```js
const Dashboard = () => {
    const { logout, user } = useAuth({ middleware: 'auth' })

    return (
        <>
            <p>{user?.name}</p>

            <button onClick={logout}>Sign out</button>
        </>
    )
}

export default Dashboard
```
